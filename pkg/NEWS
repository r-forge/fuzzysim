============================================
fuzzySim v1.6 (committed 2015-11-03)
============================================

## New functions:

* fuzzyOverlay (calculate row-wise intersection, union, expansion, contraction or consensus among continuous model predictions)

* fuzzyRangeChange (calculate overal loss, gain, and maintenance of favourability between models)


============================================
fuzzySim v1.5 (committed 2015-10-29)
============================================

## New functions:

* corSelect (select among correlated variables based on their bivariate relationship with the response)

* modOverlap (asses the total overlap between model predictions using niche comparison metrics)


## Modified functions:

* multGLM:
- 'corSelect' now included as additional option for variable selection

* FDR:
- AIC now also calculated
- 'model.type' deprecated
- 'family = "auto"' by default
- 'simplif' argument added


============================================
previous edits (that I can remember)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* multicol:
- 'model' argument added (user can provide a model object instead of a set of variables)
- variables in output are now ordered according to VIF

* simFromSetOps:
- the similarity index used is now mentioned in a message

* FDR:
- data input format changed, with former parameters 'response' and 'predictors' replaced with 'data', 'sp.cols' and 'var.cols' (for coherence and compatibility with 'multGLM' function)
