fuzzySim v1.7.6 (committed 2016-05-05)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* corSelect:
- removed error when no corrs above threshold
- sp.cols now NULL by default (to avoid error when missing)

* multGLM:

============================================
fuzzySim v1.7.5 (committed 2016-04-26)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* FDR:
- BIC now also provided

* corSelect:
- BIC now included as selection criterion

============================================
fuzzySim v1.7.4 (committed 2016-04-15)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* multGLM:
- FDR correction now "BY" by default


============================================
fuzzySim v1.7.3 (committed 2016-04-12)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* corSelect:
- error message when length(sp.cols) > 1
- message about excluded missing data
- added option sp.cols=NULL to get only high.cor.mat

* multGLM:
- added 'correction' argument to pass to 'FDR'


============================================
fuzzySim v1.7.2 (committed 2016-03-22)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* fuzzyRangeChange:
- user can now choose which measures to calculate
- 'loss' now reported as originally negative
- results provided also as a barplot


============================================
fuzzySim v1.7.1 (committed 2016-03-17)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* multTSA:
- eliminated call to 'attach'


============================================
fuzzySim v1.7 (committed 2016-02-12)
============================================

## New functions:

* pairwiseRangemaps (calculate area of pairwise intersection and union between rangemaps)

* rangemapSim (calculate  rangemap similarity using common similarity indices)


============================================
fuzzySim v1.6.3 (committed 2015-12-02)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* FDR:
- now uses only finite sp.col values


============================================
fuzzySim v1.6.2 (committed 2015-11-23)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* fuzzyRangeChange:
- corrected proportional changes to be relative to reference range size, not total study area
- replaced "stable" with "stable presence" and added (fuzzy equivalent of) "stable absence"
- replaced "change" with "balance" (overall loss/gain, not amount of changed cells)
- result is now data frame, not named vector

* distPres:
- now allows NA values


============================================
fuzzySim v1.6.1 (committed 2015-11-13)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* fuzzyOverlay:
- added arguments 'prop = TRUE' and 'overlay.cols = 1:ncol(data)'
- result now includes 4 (not 8) values, either sum or proportion
- result is now a named vector instead of a list
- 'na.rm' now TRUE by default

* fuzSim: 
- added argument 'na.rm = TRUE'

* multGLM: 
- bug corrected in corSelect (was reporting but not really eliminating variables)
- suppressMessages in corSelect


## Modified help files:

* fuzzyOverlay: modifications reflecting function changes

* modOverlap: example now provided

* fuzzyOverlay, fuzzyRangeChange, modOverlap:
- examples containing 'jitter' corrected to avoid values outside the [0, 1] interval

* fuzSim: 
- examples now provided also for similarity between fuzzy data
- tables of significance for Jaccard and Baroni's indices now referred


============================================
fuzzySim v1.6 (committed 2015-11-03)
============================================

## New functions:

* fuzzyOverlay (calculate row-wise intersection, union, expansion, contraction or consensus among continuous model predictions)

* fuzzyRangeChange (calculate overal loss, gain, and maintenance of favourability between models)


============================================
fuzzySim v1.5 (committed 2015-10-29)
============================================

## New functions:

* corSelect (select among correlated variables based on their bivariate relationship with the response)

* modOverlap (asses the total overlap between model predictions using niche comparison metrics)


## Modified functions:

* multGLM:
- 'corSelect' now included as additional option for variable selection

* FDR:
- AIC now also calculated
- 'model.type' deprecated
- 'family = "auto"' by default
- 'simplif' argument added


============================================
previous edits (that I can remember)
============================================

## Modified functions:

* multicol:
- 'model' argument added (user can provide a model object instead of a set of variables)
- variables in output are now ordered according to VIF

* simFromSetOps:
- the similarity index used is now mentioned in a message

* FDR:
- data input format changed, with former parameters 'response' and 'predictors' replaced with 'data', 'sp.cols' and 'var.cols' (for coherence and compatibility with 'multGLM' function)
