False Discovery Rate
}
\description{
Calculate the false discovery rate (type I error) under repeated testing and determine which variables to select and to exclude from multivariate analysis.
}
\usage{
FDR(data = NULL, sp.cols = NULL, var.cols = NULL, pvalues = NULL, model.type, 
family = "binomial", correction = "fdr", q = 0.05, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{a data frame containing the response and predictor variables 
  (one in each column).}
  \item{sp.cols}{index number of the column containing the response variable 
  (currently implemented for only one response variable at a time).}
  \item{var.cols}{index numbers of the columns containing the predictor variables.}
  \item{pvalues}{optionally, instead of \code{data}, \code{sp.cols} and \code{var.cols}, 
  a data frame with the names of the predictor variables in the first column and 
  their bivariate p-values (obtained elsewhere) in the second column. Example:
  pvalues <- data.frame(var = letters[1:5], pval = c(0.02, 0.004, 0.07, 0.03, 0.05)).}
  \item{model.type}{either "LM" (linear model, for continuous response variables) 
  or "GLM" (generalized linear models, for binary or other variables for which 
  such models are more appropriate)}
  \item{family}{if \code{model.type = "GLM"}, the error distribution and link 
  function (see \code{\link{glm}} or \code{\link{family}} for details); defaults 
  to "binomial" (for binary logistic regression).}
  \item{correction}{the correction procedure to apply to the p-values; see 
  \code{\link{p.adjust.methods}} for available options and \code{\link{p.adjust}} 
  for more information. The default is "fdr".}
  \item{q}{the threshold value of FDR-corrected significance above which to 
  reject variables. Defaults to 0.05.}
  \item{verbose}{logical, whether to report a short description of the results.}
}
\details{
It is common in ecology to search for statistical relationships between species' 
occurrence and a set of predictor variables. However, when a large number of 
variables is analysed (compared to the number of observations), false findings 
may arise due to repeated testing. Garcia (2003) recommended controlling the 
false discovery rate (FDR; Benjamini & Hochberg 1995) in ecological studies. 
The \code{\link{p.adjust}} R function performs this and other corrections to 
the significance (p) values of variables under repeated testing. The \code{FDR} 
function performs repeated regressions (either linear or binary logistic) or 
uses already-obtained p values for a set of variables; calculates the FDR with 
\code{\link{p.adjust}}; and shows which variables should be retained for or 
excluded from further multivariate analysis according to their corrected 
p values (see, for example, Barbosa, Real & Vargas 2009).

The FDR function uses the Benjamini & Hochberg ("BH") correction by default, 
but check the \code{\link{p.adjust}} documentation for other available methods. 
Input data may be the response variable (for example, the presence-absence 
or abundance of a species) and the predictors (a table with one independent 
variable in each column, with the same number of rows and in the same order as 
the response); there should be no missing values in the data. Model type can 
be either "LM" (linear model) for continuous response variables such as 
abundance, or "GLM" (generalized linear model) for binary responses such as 
presence-absence. Alternatively, you may already have performed the univariate 
regressions and have a set of variables and corresponding p values which you 
want to correct with FDR; in this case, get a table with your variables' names 
in the first column and their p values in the second column, and supply it as 
the \code{pvalues} argument to the \code{FDR} function (no need to provide 
response or predictors in this case).

\value{
A list with the following components:
\item{exclude}{a data frame of the variables to exclude under the chosen criteria, 
including the variables' names, their bivariate coefficients against the response, 
their p-value and adjusted p-value.}
\item{select}{a data frame similar to the above for the variables to select.}
