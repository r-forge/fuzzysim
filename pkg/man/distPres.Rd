\title{
(Inverse) distance to the nearest presence
}
\description{
This function takes a matrix or data frame containing species presence (1) and absence (0) data and their spatial coordinates (optionally also a pre-calculated distance matrix between all localities), and calculates the (inverse) distance from each locality to the nearest presence locality for each species.
}
\usage{
distPres(data, sp.cols, coord.cols = NULL, id.col = NULL, 
dist.mat = NULL, method = "euclidian", suffix = "_D", p = 1, 
inv = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
a matrix or data frame containing, at least, two columns with spatial coordinates, and one column per species containing their presence (1) and absence (0) data, with localities in rows.
}
  \item{sp.cols}{
names or index numbers of the columns containing the species presences and absences in \code{data}. It must contain only zeros (0) for absences and ones (1) for presences.
}
  \item{coord.cols}{
names or index numbers of the columns containing the spatial coordinates in data (in this order, x and y, or longitude and latitude).
}
  \item{id.col}{
optionally, the name or index number of a column (to be included in the output) containing locality identifiers in data.
}
  \item{dist.mat}{
optionally, if you do not want distances calculated with any of the methods available in \code{\link{dist}}, you may provide a distance matrix calculated elsewhere for the localities in \code{data}.
}
  \item{method}{
the method with which to calculate distances between localities. Available options are those of \code{\link{dist}}. The default is \code{"euclidian"}.
}
  \item{suffix}{
character indicating the suffix to add to the distance columns in the resulting data frame. The default is \code{"_D"}.
}
  \item{p}{
the power to which distance should be raised. The default is 1; use 2 or higher if you want more conservative distances.
}
  \item{inv}{
logical value indicating whether distance should be inverted, so that it varies between 0 and 1 and higher values mean closer to presence. The default is \code{TRUE}, which is adequate as a fuzzy version of presence-absence (for using e.g. with \code{\link{fuzSim}} and \code{\link{simMat}}). In this case, presences maintain the value 1, and inverse distance to presence is calculated only for absence localities.
}
}
\details{
This functin can be used to calculate a simple spatial interpolation model of a species' distribution (e.g. Barbosa 2015, Areias-Guerreiro et al. 2016).
}
\value{
\code{distPres} returns a matrix or data frame containing the identifier column
(if provided in \code{id.col}) and one column per species containing the
distance (inverse squared by default) from each locality to the nearest
presence of that species.
