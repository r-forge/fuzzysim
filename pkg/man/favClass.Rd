\title{
Classify favourability into 3 categories (low, intermediate, high)
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of \code{\link{Fav}}ourability values and reclassifies them into 3 increasing categories: low, intermediate or high. By default, the breaks between these classes are 0.2 and 0.8 (see Details), although these can be changed by the user.
}
\usage{
favClass(fav, breaks = c(0.2, 0.8), character = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fav}{a numeric vector of favourability values (obtained, e.g., with functions \code{\link{Fav}} or \code{\link{multGLM}}).}
  \item{breaks}{a numeric vector of length 2 containing the two values which will divide \code{fav} into the 3 classes. Defaults to c(0.2, 0.8) following the literature (see Details).}
  \item{character}{logical value indicating whether the result should be returned in character rather numeric form. Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\details{
Some applications of species distribution models imply setting a threshold to separate areas with high and low probability or favourability for occurrence (see, e.g., \code{\link{bioThreat}}). However, it makes little sense to establish as markedly different areas with, for example, 0.49 and 0.51 favourability values (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1989). It may thus be wiser to open a gap between values considered as clearly favourable and clearly unfavourable. When this option is taken in the literature, commonly used breaks are 0.8 as a threshold to classify highly favourable values, as the odds are more than 4:1 favourable to the species; 0.2 as a threshold below which to consider highly unfavourable values, as odds are less than 1:4; and classifying the remaining values as intermediate favourability (e.g., Munoz & Real 2006, Olivero et al. 2016).
}
\value{
This function returns either an integer or a character vector (following the 'character' argument, which is set to FALSE by default), of the same length as \code{fav}, reclassifying it into 3 categories: 1 ('low'), 2 ('intermediate'), or 3 ('high').
