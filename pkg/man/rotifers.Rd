\title{
Rotifer species on TDWG level 3 regions of the world
}
\description{
These data were extracted from a database of monogonont rotifer species records on the geographical units used by the Biodiversity Information Standards (formerly Taxonomic Database Working Group, TDWG; base maps available at http://www.kew.org/science-research-data/kew-in-depth/gis/resources-and-publications/data/tdwg/index.htm). The original data were compiled and published by Fontaneto et al. (2012) for all TDWG levels. Here they are reduced to the TDWG - level 3 units and to the species recorded in at least 80 of these units. Mind that this is not a complete picture of these species' distributions, due to insufficient sampling in many regions.
