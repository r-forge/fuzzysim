\title{
Calculate similarity from set operations
}
\description{
This function calculates pair-wise similarity based on the results of set operations (intersection, union) among the subjects.
}
\usage{
simFromSetOps(size1, size2, intersection, union, total.size = NULL, 
method = c("Jaccard", "Sorensen", "Simpson", "Baroni"), 
verbosity = 1)
}
\arguments{
  \item{size1}{
size of subject 1 (e.g., area of the distribution range of a species, or its number of presences within a grid). Not needed if \code{method = "Jaccard"}.
}
  \item{size2}{
the same for subject 2.
}
  \item{intersection}{
size of the intersection among subjects 1 and 2 (area of the intersection among their distribution ranges, or number of grid cells in which they co-occur).
}
  \item{union}{
size of the union of subjects 1 and 2.
}
  \item{total.size}{
total size of the study area. Needed only when calculating a similarity index that takes shared absences into account (i.e., \code{method = "Baroni"}).
}
  \item{method}{
the similarity index to use. Currently implemented options are \code{'Jaccard'}, \code{'Sorensen'}, \code{'Simpson'} and \code{'Baroni'}.
}
  \item{verbosity}{
integer indicating whether to display messages.
}
}
\details{
Similarities among ecological communities, beta diversity patterns, biotic regions, and distributional relationships among species are commonly determined based on pair-wise (dis)similarities in species' occurrence patterns. This function implements some of the most commonly employed similarity indices, namely those of Jaccard (1901), Sorensen (1948), Simpson (1960) and Baroni-Urbani & Buser (1976), based on the amount of occupied and overlap area between two species.
}
\value{
The numeric value of similarity among subjects 1 and 2.

\examples{
# take two species which occur in 22 and 35 area units, respectively
# and which overlap in 8 of those units:

sp1 <- 22
sp2 <- 35
int <- 8
uni <- sp1 + sp2 - int


# calculate similarity between their distributions based on 
# different indices:

simFromSetOps(intersection = int, union = uni, method = "Jaccard")

simFromSetOps(sp1, sp2, int, uni, method = "Sorensen")

simFromSetOps(sp1, sp2, int, uni, method = "Simpson")


# if you want Baroni-Urbani & Buser's index
# you need to provide also the total size of your study area:

simFromSetOps(sp1, sp2, int, uni, total = 100, method = "Baroni")
